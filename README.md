# Multi-Agent Cournot Competition with Active Inference
## 🏆 Overview
This repository explores a multi-agent system simulating the Cournot competition, where firms (agents) decide production quantities to maximize their profit in an oligopolistic market. The agents operate under the Active Inference paradigm, leveraging the [pymdp](https://github.com/infer-actively/pymdp) library to model decision-making.

## 🧠 Active Inference & Cournot Competition
Active Inference is a framework rooted in Bayesian inference and the Free Energy Principle, enabling agents to perceive, predict, and act based on minimizing surprise (i.e., expected free energy).

In this context:

Agents act as firms competing in the market.
They infer market demand and competitors' actions.
They update beliefs and optimize production to maximize long-term outcomes.
## 🚀 Features
✔️ Multi-agent interaction under Cournot competition dynamics

✔️ Active Inference-based decision-making using pymdp

✔️ Adaptive learning for market equilibrium convergence
